# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
This repository is for multi-UAVs optimization for path planning with the area priority.

# Surveillance 
The drones use Surveillance area importance (SAI) values to investigate/surveil areas with high importance values. If anything comes in the area, the SAI values get updated and drones move quickly to investigate that area first. 
The drones use particle swarm optimization to plan their path ensuring the shortest path and avoiding collision.
